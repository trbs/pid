Changelog
=========

2.1.0
-----

 - Same pid support, multiple calls to the same process won't
   file when allow_samepid=True is set.

2.0.1
-----

 - Bundle AUTHOR, CHANGELOG and LICENSE with source distribution

2.0.0
-----

 - PidFile will now look at the environment variables it
   needs just before acquiring the lock instead of at
   instantiation time of the PidFile class.

 - pid is now friendly with daemon context managers such
   as python-daemon where the PidFile context manager is
   passed as a parameter.

 - The signal handler on SIGTERM is now only installed
   automatically if there is no previous signal handler
   installed.

 - You can install a custom SIGTERM handler by specifying
   a callable for 'register_term_signal_handler'.

 - All in all we tried to make sure that with version 2.0.0
   pid will play nice with other code and has sane defaults.

 - Many thanks to nnathan who's efforts coding and testing
   made this version possible.
